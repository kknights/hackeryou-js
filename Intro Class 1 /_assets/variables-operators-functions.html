  //EXERCISE 1
  //1. Ask the user for their age.
  //2. Store the answer and convert their age into seconds.
  //3. Log into the console their age in seconds.
  //4. Try concatenating the answer into a sentence: Your age in seconds is --.
  function userAge() {
    var currentAge = prompt("what is your age?");
    var daysOld = currentAge * 365;
    var ageInSeconds = daysOld * 24 * 60 * 60;
    console.log(ageInSeconds);
    console.log("Your age in seconds is " + ageInSeconds);
  }
  userAge();

  //EXERCISE 2
  //1. Create 3 variables that asks the user for three numbers.
  //2. Use a function to find the maximum of the three.
  //3. Log the answer into the console using the sentence: The maximum number is --.
  function maximumNumber() {
    var numberOne = prompt("enter a number");
    var numberTwo = prompt("enter a number");
    var numberThree = prompt("enter a number");
    var maxNumber = Math.max(numberOne, numberTwo, numberThree);
    console.log("The maximum number is " + maxNumber + ".");
  }
  maximumNumber();

  // EXERCISE 3
  // Write some code that finds the youngest person out of three ages.
  // Log into the console the sentence: The youngest person is -- years old.
  //
  function youngestPerson(){
    var personOne = prompt("What's your age");
    var personTwo = prompt("What's your age");
    var personThree = prompt("What's your age");
    var youngest = Math.min(personOne, personTwo, personThree);
    console.log("The youngest person is " + youngest + " years old");
  }
  youngestPerson();


  // EXERCISE 4
  // Write some code that returns a random number between 1 and 100.
  // Log into the console the sentence: Your random number is --.
  // Bonus points for returning a whole number (no decimals).
  // Hint: Look into Math.random and Math.round
  function getRandom(min, max) {
    return Math.random(1, 100);
  }

  var randomNumber = getRandom();
  var roundedNumber = Math.round(randomNumber);
  console.log("Your random number is " + roundedNumber);

  // // EXERCISE 5
  // Write some code that adds sales tax to a price.
  // Log into the console the sentence: "The total price with tax is $--."
  // Bonus points if you can get it to show 2 decimals. (Google it!)

function addSalesTax(){
  var price = 19.99;
  var salesTax = 0.13;
  var totalPrice = price + (price * salesTax);
  totalPrice = totalPrice.toFixed(2);
  console.log("The total price with tax is " + "$" + totalPrice + ".");
