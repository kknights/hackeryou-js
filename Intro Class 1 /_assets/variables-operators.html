  // EXERCISE 1:
  // Create a variable to hold the user input from the prompt.
  var faveFood = prompt("What is your favorite food?");
  // console.log this sentence into the console:
  // "My favorite food is -----." using the answer from the prompt
  console.log("My favourite food is " + faveFood);

  // EXERCISE 2:
  // Create a variable with the starting value of 0.
  var numbers = 0;

  // Add 1 to the current value of that variable,
  numbers = numbers+1;

  // Log this sentence into the console:
  
  // "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."
  console.log("I baked a cookie. Now I have " + numbers + " cookie.");

  // Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable,
  // then (once again) re-assign the new value to the same variable.
  numbers = numbers - 1;

  // Log this sentence into the console:
  // "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
  console.log("I just ate a cookie. Now I have " + numbers + " cookies left.");
