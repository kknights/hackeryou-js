  <!-- Create a 'mad libs' game.

  ## Step 1

  prompt the user for 3 seperate words.
  - A noun.
  - An adjective.
  - An adverb.

  using these choices, `console.log` a mad lib where the prompts replace the blanks...

  "After they did that, the king played chess on his brother's
  __________(noun) and then combed his __________ (adjective)
  hair with a comb made out of old fish bones.
  Later, that same day, I saw the Monkey King dance __________
  (adverb) in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats."

  ## Step 2

  instead of generating a set mad lib, pick a random one between two options and console log the result.

  you'll need to...

  -get a random number between 1 and 2 (look back at using `Math` in javascript)
  -`console.log` a different madlib if that number is 1, or if that number is 2

  "The day I saw the Monkey King
  __________(adverb) sing. It was one of the most
  __________(adjective) days of the year.
  Everyone brought their _________(noun) and was havin a great time!" -->



  <script>

  function madLibs(){
    var noun = prompt("Enter a noun");
    var adjective = prompt("Enter an adjective");
    var adverb = prompt("Enter an adverb");
    var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);

    if (randomNumber === 0) {
      console.log("After they did that, the king played chess on his brother's " + noun + " and then combed his " + adjective + " hair with a comb made out of old fish bones. Later, that same day, I saw the Monkey King dance " + adverb + " in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats.");

    } else {
      console.log("The day I saw the Monkey King " + adverb + " sing. It was one of the most " + adjective + " days of the year. Everyone brought their " + noun + " and was having a great time!");

    }
  }
  madLibs();
