  // 1. The following function isn't printing anything to the console. Can you spot the syntax error? Be sure to check your console for errors.

  function iLoveCoffee(){
    console.log("Coffee is delicious.");
  }
  iLoveCoffee();


  // 2. The following function isn't printing anything to the console.  What did we forget?

  function iLovePizza(){
    console.log("Pizza is my favourite food!");
  }
  iLovePizza();

  // 3. Write a function `singMeASong()` that logs the text "Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy,But here's my number, So call me, maybe!" to the console.

  function singMeASong(){
    console.log("Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy,But here's my number, So call me, maybe!");
  }
  singMeASong();

  // 4. Change this `iReallyLovePizza` function to accept a single `topping` argument, then log the argument to the console.

  function iReallyLovePizza(topping){
    console.log("I love pizza!");
    console.log(`And my favourite topping is ${topping}`);
    //log your favourite topping to the console here
  }
  iReallyLovePizza("pineapple");


  // 5. Write a function with one parameter, `whatsForDinner(meal)`, which alerts the name of the meal passed to it. Call your function three times with a different meal argument each time.
  function whatsForDinner(meal){
    alert(meal);
  }
  whatsForDinner("chicken and coleslaw")
  whatsForDinner("sushi")
  whatsForDinner("pizza")

  // 6. Write a function `multiply(n1, n2)` that returns the value of n1 and n2 multiplied together. *Hint:* We use the `*` character to denote multiplication in JavaScript. Make sure you test to see that your function does what you expect.

  function multiply(n1, n2){
    return (n1*n2);
  }
  multiply(2,3);

  // 7. Write a function `greaterThanThree(n)` which logs "Yes" to the console if a n is greater than three. *Hint:* You will need to use the `>` comparrison operator and a conditional statement inside your function.
  function greaterThanThree(n){
    if (n > 3)
    console.log("yes");
  }
  greaterThanThree(9);
